# drone-on-kubernetes
Kubernetes files to deploy Drone CI (WORKING IN PROGRESS)

## Features
- Working in progress. This configuration should work, but for some reason in my case, the containers deployed by the Drone Agent can't reach Internet. As fas as I know, Drone was successfully deployed in Kubernetes for other persons.
- Uses a persistent volume for SQLite. You can rid of it if you configure an external relational database.
